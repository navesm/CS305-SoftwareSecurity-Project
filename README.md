Artemis Financial Software Security Report

The client, Artemis Financial, was looking to modernize their custom software suite and ensure it had the highest level of software security for their business of offering various customized financial plans including savings, retirement, investments, and insurance. 

Utilizing both manual review and static dependency checking within the Java application allowed for the location and remediation of software security vulnerabilities. Additionally, it was necessary to refactor the code and modularize, abstract, and separate concerns as well as ensuring the principles of least privilege were used. 
Another concern that needed to be addressed was sanitizing and validating inputs for the application as well as securing the API endpoints from malicious or unintended manipulation.

After updating and addressing vulnerable dependencies, it was crucial to determine that no breaking changes had occurred, or that in so doing new vulnerabilities were not introduced. This is a part of the interative nature of the secure software development life cycle. 
Utilizing manual and static code review and testing methodologies will be useful for similar tasks into the future, both for Artemis Financial as well as other clients.
